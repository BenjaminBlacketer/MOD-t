MOD-t Calibration Tests
=======================

Singlewallcalibration35.stl is for use in setting the the 'Extrusion multiplier' in the 'Filamnet Settings' tab of Slic3r as documented here: https://github.com/alexrj/Slic3r/wiki/Calibration (There is a an STL file there that can also be used.)

I've provided Singlewallcalibration35.gcode which has been sliced with the MOD-t_slic3r_config.ini settings as a convenience for those who may have not yet installed Slic3r and would just like to try printing a single wall part.

Singlewallcalibration35.png is a rendering of the part for reference.

The part is a 35x35x35mm cube with one edge at a 11.667mm (35mm/3) radius.
